The main aim of this repository is to simplify the process of connecting Espressif ESP chips/modules to the main cloud based IoT infrastructures. 

This is to be achieved by taking advantage of a set of the best ideas and implementations available for the Espressif ESP modules. Currently the only publicallly abailable chip is the ESP8266. More information can be found here:
